NETFLIX_SQL_PROJECT

This project involves exploring and analyzing Netflix's content library using structured data and SQL queries. The dataset includes details like show type (Movie/TV Show), title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and genre. Using SQL, the goal is to extract insights such as the types of content available, content trends over time, the most prolific directors, and the distribution of content by country and genre.
The analysis was conducted using PostgreSQL, focusing on querying techniques such as filtering, grouping, aggregation, sorting, and subqueries. The project provides valuable insights that can support content strategy, regional preferences, and release trends.
